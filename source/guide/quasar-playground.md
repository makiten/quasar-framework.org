You can fork and use these links for reporting issues on Github too. These links (obviously) use the Quasar UMD version.

Make sure to read [about it](/guide/embedding-quasar.html) before diving in. When you use jsFiddle/Codepen you can skip the Installation section.

### Quasar Play
Live Demo:
* [Material Theme](http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase)
* [iOS Theme](http://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/apple/index.html#/showcase)
* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quasarframework.quasarplay) (currently it's outdated, using a very old Quasar version)

Quasar Play is used for these documentation pages too, on the right side, on the mobile frame.
You can clone it and play with it by visiting its [Github page](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play).
