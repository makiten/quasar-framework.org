title: Configuring PWA
---
We'll be using Quasar CLI to develop and build a PWA. The difference between building a SPA, Mobile App, Electron App or a PWA is simply determined by the "mode" parameter in "quasar dev" and "quasar build" commands.

## Installation
In order to build a PWA, we first need to add the PWA mode to our Quasar project:
```bash
$ quasar mode -a pwa
```

If you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the "quasar mode" command and issue:
```bash
$ quasar dev -m pwa
```
This will add PWA mode automatically, if it is missing.

## Service Worker
Adding PWA mode to a Quasar project means a new folder will be created: `/src-pwa`, which contains PWA specific files:
```bash
.
└── src-pwa/
    ├── service-worker-dev.js   # Development Service Worker
    └── service-worker-prod.js  # Production Service Worker
```

You can freely edit these files. Notice that the development uses a separate Service Worker than the production build. This service worker (`/src-pwa/service-worker-dev.js`) file is effectively a 'no-op' that will reset any previous service worker registered for the same host:port combination. In the production build, this file is replaced with an actual service worker file that will pre-cache your site's local assets: `/src-pwa/service-worker-prod.js`.

## Configuring Manifest File
The Manifest file is generated by Quasar CLI by using `sw-precache-webpack-plugin` package and a default configuration for it. You can however tweak this configuration from `/quasar.conf.js`.

Example taken from Quasar Play's quasar.conf.js:
```js
pwa: {
  cacheId: '...' // default taken from package.json > name field or 'quasar-pwa-app'
  cacheExt: 'js,html,css,ttf,eot,otf,woff,woff2,json,svg,gif,jpg,jpeg,png,wav,ogg,webm,flac,aac,mp4,mp3',
  manifest: {
    name: 'Quasar Play',
    short_name: 'Quasar-Play',
    description: 'Quasar Framework Showcase',
    icons: [
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-128x128.png',
        'sizes': '128x128',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-192x192.png',
        'sizes': '192x192',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-256x256.png',
        'sizes': '256x256',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-384x384.png',
        'sizes': '384x384',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-512x512.png',
        'sizes': '512x512',
        'type': 'image/png'
      }
    ],
    display: 'standalone',
    orientation: 'portrait',
    background_color: '#ffffff',
    theme_color: '#027be3'
  }
}
```

Please read about the [manifest config](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) before diving in.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Note that you don't need to edit your index.html file (generated from `/src/index.template.html`) to link to the manifest file. Quasar CLI takes care of embedding the right things for you.

## PWA Checklist

> **IMPORTANT**
> Do not run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) on your development build. It is not optimized and does not contain a true Service Worker.
