title: Quasar Roadmap
---

Next version is v1.0, with four main focus points:
* SSR (Server Side Rendering) Quasar Mode
* Quasar + Nuxt starter kit
* Notable improvements to the form components
* Total documentation website revamp, using Quasar SSR. Better "view source" functionality, with ability to fork and play each example on JsFiddle.
* Out of the box Typescript support (can be added now too)

Notable features on the roadmap for longer term (some might end up in v1.0):
* Chrome (+ Firefox) extension support
* Tipster component
* List Item Sliding with Actions component
* Virtual Lists component
* Finalizing RTL support
